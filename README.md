Installation with DKMS
----------------------
Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) is a program/framework that enables generating Linux kernel modules whose sources generally reside outside the kernel source tree. The concept is to have DKMS modules automatically rebuilt when a new kernel is installed. -  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support)

Installing the asus-fan kernel module with DKMS means that when you upgrade to a new kernel you do not need to repeat the process outlined below in the Quickstart section each time. The asus-fan kernel module will automatically be rebuilt when a new kernel is installed.

More information on DKMS: [Ubuntu Help - DKMS](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DKMS)

Scripted Ubuntu DKMS Setup for Asus Fan Module
--------------------
* Download the `ubuntu_dkms_sudo_install.sh` script from the `misc` folder of this repository. (ie. right-click over **Raw** > select **Save link as...**)
* Make sure the script is executable (ie. `chmod +x ubuntu_dkms_sudo_install.sh`)
* Run the script (ie. `./ubuntu_dkms_sudo_install.sh`)
* The script will need super user powers and will ask you to enter your password to get sudo permissions
* Check that the module has been built and installed with `lsmod | grep asus_fan`. If you get something lik **asus_fan               14880  0** you are good. If you get nothing the module is not loaded.


Manual Ubuntu DKMS Setup for Asus Fan Module
---------------------
    cd /usr/src
    sudo wget -o asus-fan-master.tar.gz  https://github.com/daringer/asus-fan/archive/master.tar.gz
    sudo mkdir asus_fan-master
    cd asus_fan-master
    sudo tar xpvf ../asus_fan.tar.gz --strip-components=1
    sudo  tar xpvf ../asus_fan.tar.gz --strip-component
    sudo  mv dkms.conf dkms.conf.archlinux
    sudo mv dkms-ubuntu.conf dkms.conf
    cd ..
    sudo dkms add -m asus_fan -v master
    sudo dkms install -m asus_fan -v master
    sudo echo asus_fan >>/etc/modules

Quickstart - Manual installation
----------

- **Build** - just run ```make``` inside the directory
- **Install** - run ```sudo make install``` inside the directory
- **Load** - simply as usual:
```bash
modprobe asus_fan
```
- **Interface** - the fan(s) is/are exposed as ```hwmon```, thus available in:
```bash
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmonX
```
- **Monitor Fan speed** -simply use xsensors or psensors for graphical, or sensors for console monitoring
```

- **Set Fan Speed** - write anything from 0 to 255 to ```pwmX```, like:
```bash
echo 123 > ${fpath}/pwmX   # set to 123
echo 0 > ${fpath}/pwmX     # switch fan off (DANGEROUS!)
echo 255 > ${fpath}/pwmX   # set to max speed
```
- **ATTENTION** - the fan is now in manual mode - do not burn your machine!
- **Set Auto-Fan(s)**: to reactivate the automatic fan control write "0" to ```pwmX_enable```:
```bash
echo 0 > ${fpath}/pwmX_enable   # reset to auto-mode (always for all fans)
```

- **Max fan speed** There is an additional file for controling the maximum fan speed. It's r/w and controls both, automatic mode and manual mode maximum speed. Value range: 0-255 reset value:256


Short Comparison To Other Similar Projects
------------------------------------------
- [asus-fancontrol](https://github.com/nicolai-rostov/asus-fancontrol) userland application, acpi_call based, limited number of (offical/tested) compatible zenbook models, no (standard) interface exposed, no support for second fan
- [zenbook](https://github.com/juyrjola/zenbook) userland appliaction, acpi_call based, only UX32VD supported, no (standard) interface exposed, no support for second fan
- [asusfan](https://github.com/gpiemont/asusfan) kernelspace driver, model support: A8J, A8JS, N50V[cn], no (standard) interface exposed, interface based on module parameters, replaces automatic control with own realization, no support for second fan
- [asusfan (original)](https://code.google.com/p/asusfan/) kernelspace driver, Model support A8J and A8JS, no (standard) interface, automatic fan speed adjustment, no support for second fan
- [asusfanctrld](https://github.com/nflx/asusfanctrld) userland (bash) application, acpi_call  based, only UX32VD, second fan support?, no (standard) interface exposed
- [asus_ux32v_fan_control](https://github.com/chrischdi/asus_ux32v_fan_control) is actually a fork of this project undergone a renaming (hmm), very old state, no hwmon (interface) support, thermal_device interface, most likely as buggy as this project was one year ago
- [asus_wmi](https://github.com/KastB/asus_wmi) realization as a part of the exisiting `asus_wmi` module, which is maybe the only way to submit it for the upstream kernel, nevertheless support for the second fan is not available through wmi. Sister project, closely related to the one shown here.

So this [project](https://github.com/daringer/asus-fan) distinguishes itself from the others by providing a **hwmon standard state-of-art interface** with a wide variety of **supported zenbook models** realized as a **kernelspace driver**. Guess you found the *right* one ;)


Tools / Configs / Simple Fancontrol Script
------------------------------------------

- **fancontrol** - There is a script called "fancontrol" that can be configured according to temperature source, fans to control, minimum and maximum temperature...
thats done by "pwmconfig"
Nevertheless that script did it worse for me than the original controller - thus you can tell it to stop the fan completely...

**TODOs**:
----------
- do a code review and clean it up
- check with more models
- add an included fan controller
- setting 'fanX_max' to 256 in order to reset all values to default, seems not a standard behavior --- where to put this functionality?
- submit an upstream patch - any howtos?? wtf, write acpi-devel kernel-mailinglist ??
